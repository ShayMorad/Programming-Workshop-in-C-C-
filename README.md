# 📘 HUJI – Programming Workshop in C/C++
This repository features my completed solutions for the 6 exercises assigned in the Programming Workshop in C/C++ course at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/). 

Throughout the 13-week course, we explored key programming principles using C/C++, covering topics from **memory management** and **object-oriented programming** to **generic programming**.
